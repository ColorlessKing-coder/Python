# 🐍 Python Projects Collection

Welcome to my **personal collection of small Python projects**! 🎯  
These mini-projects are created to experiment with ideas, solve specific problems, or simply practice coding in Python. While some may be very simple, they aim to demonstrate clear and functional implementations of core programming concepts. ✨

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder inside this repository represents a standalone Python project.  
Inside each project folder, you’ll typically find:

- 🐍 Python scripts (`.py` files)
- 📄 A short description or documentation
- ⚙️ Optionally, requirements or config files

---

## 🚀 How to Use

Most of the scripts can be executed directly via the terminal.  
Many projects support `-h` or `--help` arguments to display usage instructions.

```bash
python project_name.py -h
